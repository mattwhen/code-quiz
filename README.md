# JavaScript Code Quiz

## Description 
This web application will test a user's knowledge in JavaScript with a multiple-choice quiz that renders different questions and choices on the page after the user selects the correct answer. The user will have a total of 60 seconds to complete the quiz but will be penalized by 5 seconds if the user selects the incorrect choice and will remain on the same question until the correct answer is chosen. Once the user completes the entire quiz, they are presented with their final score (basically the time remaining is their score) that they will submit using their initials.

## How it was made
This project was created using the DOM to render different content and styles to the user upon user activity, such as clicking the "Start!" button on the main page or selecting the correct choice from the list of options for every question. Local storage was also utilized for this project to store the user's score along with their initials which is displayed in the High Score page or link on the webpage which is sorted from the highest to lowest score.

## Challenges
Some of the challenges that I faced when building this project was how to display all the questions on the same webpage using the DOM. Also how to target the right button element when it is the correct answer for the quiz and how to prevent the quiz from proceeding if the user selects the incorrect choice.
